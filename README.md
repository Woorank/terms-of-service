## 13. FAIR USE POLICY

### What does this Fair Use Policy mean?

WooRank is a Product and Service that helps thousands of customers each day and we cannot allow the actions of a few users to negatively influence the system performance for the majority. Some types of activities are obviously violations, such as exploiting multiple trials of the paid features. However, certain activities can cause review performance issues. These activities are difficult to summarize in a policy but are usually caused by a combination of items such as excessive downloading outside of what a normal person could do themselves, attempting to scrape the website, sharing your single log-in with multiple users, etc. As such, we retain the right to intervene in order to uphold the overall WooRank high-quality user experience.

### When do we invoke the Fair Use Policy?

WooRank retains the right to limit or halt access to the Product and Service to any user imposing excessive load on the WooRank system in a way that will compromise the system performance for the majority. WooRank is designed with single user login in mind, excessive (beyond the norm of justified high usage) reporting may be met with a wait time message or a complete halt in our services.

Such users who exhibit behaviors beyond the norm of justified high usage and have their WooRank access revoked can contact &#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#087;&#111;&#111;&#082;&#097;&#110;&#107;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; to discuss a tailored enterprise proposal.

### What happens when we invoke the Fair Use Policy?

WooRank wishes to keep its customers satisfied, even those who are in violation of the Fair Use Policy, because we acknowledge that this might not be intentional. Excessive reporting may be met with a wait time message, evening out the load on the system for all users. In extenuating circumstances, if we invoke the Fair Use Policy by limiting or halting the Product and Service, impacted users can contact &#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#087;&#111;&#111;&#082;&#097;&#110;&#107;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; to learn more or regain access with a tailored Enterprise plan that better fits their needs.
